# Motivation

Explain what is kiteboarding

Explain kite sizes and why we separate in 15, 20 and 25 mph

# Data


```{r data_setup, include=FALSE}
executionStart <- Sys.time()
source('WeatherTest.R')
# General variables:
stationID <- "IYUCATNT2"
loc <- getPWSLocation(stationID)
startDateStr <- "2012/01/01"
#startDateStr <- "2016/01/01"
endDateStr <- "2016/12/31"
#endDateStr <- "2016/01/31"

sustainedWindTh <- 2

```

## Data Sources

```{r location, include=FALSE}
# Helper vars
latStr <- loc[1,"lat"]
lonStr <- loc[1,"lon"]
```

Data obtained from “Weather Underground” webpage.

Original source is the weather station from the CINVESTAV (Mexican research center), ID `r stationID`, located in Telchac Yucatan. Coordinates are latitude `r latStr` and longitude `r lonStr`

### Summary of the Data

```{r sample_date, include=FALSE}
# Helper vars
#sampleDate <- "January 15, 2016" #orig
sampleDate <- "April 18, 2016"
#sampleDate <- "March 20, 2016"
startYear <- year(startDateStr)
endYear <- year(endDateStr)
yearSpan <- 1 + endYear-startYear 

sampleData <- getPWSData(stationID, as.Date(sampleDate,"%B %d, %Y")) %>%
  select(Time,WindDirection,WindDirectionDegrees,WindSpeedMPH,WindSpeedGustMPH)

#TODO : use real start and end
rawDataInfo <- getRawData(stationID,startDateStr,endDateStr)
#rawDataInfo <- getRawData(stationID,"2012/01/01","2012/03/31")

```

We analyzed a total of `r yearSpan` years of data from `r startYear` to `r endYear`. The information was obtained from weather underground website giving a single web page summary per day. This is an extract from `r sampleDate`:

```{r sample_data}
knitr::kable(head(sampleData))
```

There are many more columns related to pressure, temperature, dew point, etc. but for this analysis we only focused on the following:

_Time_ : the timestamp at which the sample is taken.

_WindDirection_ : Cardinal direction where the wind is coming from. Not really used for analysis but just for display.

_WindDirectionDegrees_ : This is the wind direction in degrees. The cardinal directions map as follow: North is 0, East 90, South 180 and West 270.

_WindSpeedMPH_ : Wind speed measured in miles per hour.

_WindSpeedGustMPH_ : Wind gust measured in miles per hour.

During the period of `r yearSpan` years a total of `r rawDataInfo$records` records were read from the web and `r rawDataInfo$badRecords` were missing from the server. This gives a total of `r nrow(rawDataInfo$data)` measurements to analyze.

This is the summary of the data from the raw data set:

```{r raw_data_summary}
knitr::kable(summary(rawDataInfo$data))
```

We could easily spot there are negative values for the 3 columns of interest. Those are impossible values for those columns, further analysis showed that's the way the server reports the NA values. In case of wind direction there is also very big positive values greater than 360. When the wind speed is zero the server sometimes reports the direction as a negative value but when the direction reading is missing it reports it as a very high positive. The maximum numbers for wind speed and gust seem to be on a reasonable range so we consider them good readings.

Finally there are some entries in the data set that have duplicated Time values. They are not exactly duplicated readings since they could have other values in the remaining columns. It looks like sometimes some readings that were intended to happen minutes apart were recorded in the same timestamp. Instead of trying to guess the correct timestamp we simply deleted them, there were only `r sum(duplicated(rawDataInfo$data$Time))` entries in this situation plus future cleanup will minimize the effects of deleting them.

This is a summary of the data cleanup.

Condition                  | Action
---------------------------|--------------
WindDirectionDegrees < 0   | Convert to NA
WindDirectionDegrees > 360 | Convert to NA
WindSpeedMPH < 0           | Convert to NA
WindSpeedGustMPH < 0       | Convert to NA
duplicated(Time)           | Delete




## Temporal Data

The data is a time series which should be indexed by the Time column. The data set doesn’t have any information of the time zone which becomes important for future analysis. We had to force such information to the Time column setting the timezone to "America/Mexico_city"

The minimum difference between readings of the same day is 5 minutes but there are situations when the reading for the next 5 min is not taken or the period shifts. The following table shows the 5 most common intervals in the data set (in seconds):

```{r interval_info}
Intervals <- with(rawDataInfo$data,difftime(Time[-1],Time[-length(Time)]))
intFreq <- data.frame(head(sort(table(Intervals),decreasing=TRUE),5))
knitr::kable(intFreq)
#colnames(tmp) <- c("Interval","Frequency")
#head(sort(table(intervals),decreasing=TRUE),5)

```


In order to make the data set more manageable for future processing we decided to make each day evenly sampled at 5 minutes interval adding interpolated values in the case of missing timestamp.

Since the data set is a temporal series we converted the data to zoo objects in R and executed the following steps for interpolation for each day:

1. Create a new empty data set (zoo) with only a time series starting with the first timestamp of the day we want to interpolate, ending with the same timestamp as the original data set and equally spaced by 5 minutes.
2. Merge the new empty data set with the old original one for the date as a full outer join creating NA readings for the timestamps that didn’t exist.
3. Use the operation na.approx on the merged zoo object which will result in approximating the NA values using interpolation between neighboring readings.
4. Merge again the empty dataset with the merged data set as a natural join. This will eliminate any irregular reading taken outside the 5 min sampling rate.

Let’s take a look at an extract of samples around noon from `r sampleDate`:


```{r interpolation_example1}
pseudoDate <- floor_date(sampleData$Time[1],unit="day")
filteredSampleData <- sampleData %>%
  filter(Time>=pseudoDate+dhours(11.5)) %>%
  filter(Time<=pseudoDate+dhours(13.5))
sampleZoo <- convertPWSData2Zoo(filteredSampleData)
plot(sampleZoo$WindSpeedMPH,type="b", main=sprintf("Wind Speed for %s",sampleDate), sub="Extract", xlab="Time", ylab="Wind Speed (MPH)")
```

The next graph is the same period of time with the interpolated samples added:

```{r interpolation_example2}
intZoo <- interpolateZoo(sampleZoo)
plot(intZoo$WindSpeedMPH,type="b", main=sprintf("Wind Speed for %s",sampleDate), sub="Interpolated", xlab="Time", ylab="Wind Speed (MPH)")

```

```{r raw_data_cleanup, include=TRUE}
ls()

rm(rawDataInfo,sampleZoo,intZoo,Intervals,pseudoDate,intFreq,filteredSampleData)

# Analysis

## Whole Data Set Analysis

```{r whole_data_set, include=FALSE}
# This section needs to be completely silenced
df <- getCleanPWSDataRange(stationID,startDateStr,endDateStr) #Whole
#knitr::kable(df) #Dont print this it is for debug only
```

The first analysis done after cleaning the date was to get a windrose diagram to see the wind speed and direction distribution for the `r yearSpan` years we are analyzing. A windrose diagram is just a histogram in polar coordinates. It is divided by month since we are interested on finding the good season for kiting.

```{r wind_rose_whole, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
# There is a warning comming from this function
windRoseCleanData(df)

```

Visually we can observe that the months of August and October look like the weakest. The winter months seem to have the highest winds overall. May seems to be a good solid month.

## Daily Summary
```{r daily_summary}
daySum <- computeDailySummary(df,loc,sustainedWindTh)
```

The information from the wind rose is a good quick outlook of how to the winds distribute along the year. 

TODO : describe the motivation of going beyond

Kiteboarding is only practice during daytime, we removed the measurements that were taken (or interpolated) at times when there was no sunlight. The sunset and sunrise times are calculated for each day using the `sunriset` function from `maptools`.

This is a summary of the computations performed using the column name in the final data frame:

_avgDlWindSpeedMPH, avgDlWindDirectionDegrees_ : This is the average wind speed and direction during the daylight. The averages are not relevant for the final report but they provided a way to do early estimation. 

_periodLength15, periodLength20, periodLength25_ : These are the most important measurements. We look for the amount of time the wind speed was equal or greater than 15, 20 and 25 mph respectively. A time range is only good if we have at least `r sustainedWindTh` hours of contiguous wind over the desired speed otherwise the time is not counted (becomes zero). If there are multiple periods going over the XXX hours threshold then they are added together. Lets use again the example of `r sampleDate`:

```{r windmeasurements}

# Doing the zoo of the whole thing:
sampleZoo <- convertPWSData2Zoo(sampleData)
sampleZoo <- interpolateZoo(sampleZoo)
plot(sampleZoo$WindSpeedMPH,type="l", main=sprintf("Wind Speed for %s",sampleDate), xlab="Time", ylab="Wind Speed (MPH)")

abline(h=15,lty="dotted")
abline(h=20,lty="dotted")
abline(h=25,lty="dotted")

rm(sampleZoo)
```

This one contains period of times where the wind speed is sustained for more than `r sustainedWindTh` hours being equal or greater than the three thresholds. Non zero values will be captured in the three of them.

_pseudoWindSpeed_ : We capture here the highest sustained speed above the predefined thresholds. In the previous graph for `r sampleDate` this field will have 25 since there is a period of time that the wind blows for more than XXX hours at 25 mph or more.

_avgDlWindSpeedMPHGt15, avgDlWindDirectionDegreesGt15_ : These are the average wind speed and direction of all the measurements greater than 15 mph. Only calculated when there was at least a period of `r sustainedWindTh` hours when the wind blows above 15 mph (periodLength15>0) otherwise they are NA. This measurements are useful for the arrow in the calendar plot.

### Calendar Plot for windy days

With this information we created a calendar plot where each day is classified into a no wind day, low wind, middle wind or high wind day based on the ranges of 15mph, 20mpg or 25mph and beyond. This is based again on the criteria of sustained wind for at least XX hours.

Whenever there is a windy day (>15mph) then we also get an arrow indicating the average wind direction of the windy range, this information comes from columns _avgDlWindSpeedMPHGt15_ and _avgDlWindDirectionDegreesGt15_. For this report only the last year is printed.


```{r calendar_last_year, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.height=8, fig.width=8}

targetDate <- year(endDateStr)
calendarDailySummary(daySum,targetDate)

```



Cleanup
```{r analysis_cleanup}
# This section needs to be completely silenced
rm(df)
```

## Monthly Report
```{r monthly_summary}
monthSum  <- computeMontlySummary(daySum)

```

Finally we process the daily information to find out how many windy days we have had in the historic data per month.

```{r monthly_plot}
plt <- ggplotMontlySummary(monthSum,startDateStr,endDateStr)
print(plt)
```
